# Units
Carbon emissions data are provided in terms of kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilometre (kgCO<sub>2</sub>/km) or kilograms of carbon dioxide per mile (kgCO<sub>2</sub>/mi) as indicated by the Unit field.

# Accuracy and Precision
While the carbon factors are provided with a high level of precision, this should not be mistaken for accuracy. Some estimation and aggregation has taken place to generate these values. While this shouldn't undermine their utility, it should always be a consideration.
